  <h1>How Authorization Works</h1>
  <p>Spartan authorization technology connects an authorized license to the
  specific hard drive on the computer onto which Spartan is
  installed.  Summitek Instruments provides an authorized Spartan license for
  a particular number of seats (i.e., simultaneous users) and a certain
  amount of time (e.g., 1 year) after the Spartan server program is installed.</p>

    <blockquote class="caution"><p><span class="strong">Caution:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    The Spartan authorization system catalogs several files in the Spartan program
    folder in addition to recording the system time.  Moving or modifying the files
    in the Spartan program folder may result in the loss of Spartan authorization.
    Additionally, changing the system time on the Spartan server by more
    than two hours will also remove authorization.</p></blockquote>


  <h2>Getting Spartan Authorized</h2>
  <p>After Spartan has been installed and the first login is made,
  the Spartan authorization screen is presented.  Contact Summitek Instruments
  with the site code (and kill code, if shown) to receive an authorization code.</p>

  <p>After entering the authorization code provided by Summitek Instruments, the
  Spartan site license will reflect the number of seats authorized (as well as the
  days until expiration, if a limited license was granted).</p>

  <p>Clicking the <span class="strong">Deauthorize</span> button will remove any
  current authorization and provide a <span class="strong">Kill Code</span> for
  verifying a valid license with Summitek Instruments.  This can be used to move
  Spartan authorization to another computer, for example.</p>
