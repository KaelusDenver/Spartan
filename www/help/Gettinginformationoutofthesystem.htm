  <h1>Getting information out of the system</h1>

  <p>Because automated testing drives the data collection process in Spartan,
  an enormous amount of useful data can be collected to monitor and refine the
  manuafacturing process.  However the saved information is only as useful
  as the process used to gather, analyze, and present it.</p>

  <h2>Data Mining Scenarios</h2>

  <p>Spartan uses the concept of data mining scenarios to simplify and centralize
  the data gathering, analysis, and presentation process.  A scenario is the
  combination of two pieces of information critical to data mining:

    <ul>
      <li>Identification of the specific data to be retrieved from the system, and</li>
      <li>Instructions on how to analyze, format, and display parts of the identified data.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>So, when running a scenario, Spartan first retrieves data matching the
  search criteria, then funnels this data through a
  <a href="/help/dataminingtemplates.htm">template</a> to
  create the visual presentation.</p>


  <h3>Searching for Data</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The top portion of a data mining scenario contains the search (or
    <span class="italic">query</span>) criteria for the desired data set.
    The primary means of identifying test data on the Spartan system are
    various attributes, or <a href="/help/testdatafields.htm">fields</a>,
    that were stored along with the data when the test was performed.  There
    are several fields automatically stored by the system, and any number
    of user-defined fields, that are available to search upon.</p>

    <p><img class="sb" height="130" width="520" src="/help/images/dataout1.png" /></p>

    <p>Spartan searches for fields with a value matching the specific field and
    operation as specified. For the example above, Spartan would
    find all test data with a Model Number equal to the string &quot;RF Widget&quot;.</p>

    <p>Adding more search conditions filters the search results in a
    top-down fashion.  Again, in the example shown here, Spartan
    would return all data with &quot;RF Widget&quot; as the Model Number value
    <span class="italic">as long as it did not also contain the string
    &quot;pilot&quot;</span> within the Serial Number value.</p>

    <p>So, Spartan search conditions are combined with a logical
    <span class="strong">AND</span> operation.  That is, Spartan finds data where
    <span class="italic">Condition 1</span>, AND <span class="italic">Condition 2</span>,
    AND <span class="italic">Condition 3</span>, AND so on... evaluate to
    a logical true.</p>

  </blockquote>


  <h3>Data Presentation</h3>
  <blockquote>
   <p>The bottom portion of a data mining scenario lists the
   <a href="/help/dataminingtemplates.htm">templates</a> that will be used to process
   and visualize the data found in the search.  Spartan templates can be categorized
   into general classes according to the way they process the search results.</p>

   <p><img class="sb" height="220" width="520" src="/help/images/dataout2.png" /></p>

   <p class="strong">Item Mapping</p>
   <p>Consider that a scenario's search results may include data for several items
   previously tested by the system.  This data can be &quot;mapped&quot; into
   reports on a one-to-one basis (i.e., one item per report) or on a many-to-one basis.</p>

   <p>For example, a single item test datasheet template might present attributes and
   graphical data regarding one particular manufactured item's RF performance
   characteristics.  Another type of datasheet template might present a table
   of performance specifications against which several produced items are shown.</p>

   <p class="strong">Content Style</p>
   <p>Templates may also present their data with a particular content style.  A basic
   distinction is whether the data is presented in a tabular or graphical format.
   Templates in any of the content style categories can be manipulated by the user
   to refine the presentation and set processing and display parameters as desired.</p>

   <p><img class="sb" height="200" width="520" src="/help/images/dataout3.png" /></p>

   <p>Templates can also be used to generate non-traditional &quot;reports&quot;.  A
   Spartan template could be used to convert measured electrical device
   characteristics into alternative formats.  A specific example of this is a
   template that converts Spartan measured vector network analyzer data (i.e.,
   scattering, or S-parameters) into the industry standard Touchstone SnP formatted
   data.</p>
