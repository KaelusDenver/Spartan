  <h1>What's new in version 5.0</h1>

  <p><span class="strong">Spartan 5 is a major new release</span> with a sharpened focus on
  quality management. We have streamlined the user interface to make the application as
  intuitive to use as possible.  This page describes the new features
  we've added to make Spartan as useful to you as possible.</p>

  <h2>Data Mining Scenarios</h2>

  <p><span class="strong">Spartan 5 introduces data mining scenarios</span> to let you work
  more easily with the data captured into the system.  This includes letting you set up and
  store complex, multi-level query criteria, and processing the results through a more flexible
  and extensible template reporting framework.</p>

  <p>Editing and running the new data mining scenarios has been made as easy as editing
  and running test sequences, and much of the user interface functionality has been duplicated
  to create a consistent experience across the application.</p>

  <p>To get started, simply click the <span class="strong">Data Mining</span> button on
  the menu bar.</p>

  <h2>Filter Specifications</h2>

  <p><span class="strong">One of the trickiest aspects of S Paremeter test design</span> is
  creating clear and consistent limit specifications.  Over time filter designers have developed a
  unique and concise terminology to address this complex issue, and we have added it into
  the <span class="strong">S&nbsp;Parameter test module</span>.</p>

  <h2>More Flexible Templates</h2>

  <p><span class="strong">Quality management requires a multitude of reporting</span>
  in various specific formats.  Spartan 5 has built upon the idea of reporting templates which
  can be customized by the user and attached to specific data mining scenarios.  The
  reports output by this system can be used for purposes as varied as manufacturing metrics
  or test article datasheets.</p>

  <p><img class="sb" height="293" width="520" src="/help/images/whatsnew3.png" /></p>

  <p>Templates are added to the system and maintained from the
  <span class="strong">Configure</span> menu.  They can be associated with 
  <span class="strong">data mining scenarios</span> and attached to specific
  <span class="strong">test sequence steps</span>.</p>
